# GA-SI
Sequence-independent Structural Alignment Method

This is an implementation of the method described in the article "Comparison of non-sequential sets of protein residues" by LD Garma and AH Juffer (Computational biology and chemistry, 2016).

The method uses a genetic algorithm to find the rotation and translation of a query structure which maximizes its similarity to a template structure, according to the formula described in the original article.
